we have 3 types of errors.
    1.Compile time error
            the error which occurs during the compile time
            these errors can be easily solved..
    2.Logical errors
            the error occurs logically 
            to avoid these we have to do testing the code..
            by this we solve the errors
    3.Run time error ->EXCEPTION
            the error which occured during the Run time due to any technical issues etc...
            this causes the code stop executing in between..
            to avoid these we have to handle this errors
            handling this errors is important 
            we call them as EXCEPTION HANDLING
